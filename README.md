# *Stroke-Prediction*

## Introduction 
- Link dataset: [Link Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset?datasetId=1120859&sortBy=voteCount)

- Context :According to the WHO stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.

- Objetive: Objetive is predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.

## Data Preprocessing
- Check and fill Null Values

- Remove outlier

- used in data analysis and statistics to group some Numerical Data into bins and assigning each data point to the corresponding bin based on its value.

## Result 

Model: Naives Bayes

| Precision | Recall | F1 Score | Accuracy |
